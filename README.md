# SIM808_MQTT

Under development

The ideia is create a simples TCP/IP connection and publish the GSP location using de MQTT protocol.

Others softwares are using the data mode with SIM808, which block the communication with de GPS. Thus the purpuse is to create a comunication transference layer and an aplication layer using non-transparent mode and keep the comunication with GPS active
