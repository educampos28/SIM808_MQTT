# SIM808_MQTT

Under development

The ideia is create a simple TCP/IP connection and publish the GSP location using de MQTT protocal.

Others softwares are using the data mode with SIM800, which block the communication with de GPS. Thus the purpuse is to create a comunication transference layer and an aplication layer using non-transparent mode and keep the comunication with GPS active
